Jesse is always positive in nature, eager to tackle new challenges, and very helpful to others. The quality of his work is excellent as a programmer. He understood how to gather requirements and develop applications that were well received by our customers. I also know him to be very proactive to learn new skill sets as well. He demonstrated initiative regularly by leading programming discussion groups and seeking to help others enhance their own skills. He exemplifies the concept of a team player. Jesse has an excellent character as well for he is honest as well as a hard worker. He has my recommendation 100%.",
